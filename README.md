Machine Learning Algorithms (Graduate Course) - Homework Implementation

HW1 - 1. Perform One Hot Encoding to raw dataset (link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation). 
      2. Implement KNN classifier to apply it to transformed data. Got accuracy from training/validation/test data.
      
HW2 - 1. Implement Bernoulli Naive Bayes and apply ti to same dataset in HW1.
      2. Compare its result (accuracy) with other classifiers (Logisitic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN).
